Grading System - User Manual

SYSTEM ADMIN:
The system administrator login page can be accessed separate from the main landing page at JANS University. Upon logging in, the admin has access to all of the courses, professors, and students in the database. The admin can either add or delete any student, course, or professor from the database. Clicking “Add Professor” or “Add Student'' will bring up a form in which the admin can input the Professor’s or Student’s information along with the password the professor or the student would like to use to login. Course pages also have their respective form pages. The password that the professor or student would like to use during account creation has a few requirements. 

The password must be:
At least 8 characters long
Contain at least one uppercase letter
Contain at least one lowercase letter
Contain at least one digit

A constraint is set upon deletion of professors that are currently teaching a course. Deleting such a professor would require the admin to first delete the course that the professor is teaching. 

PROFESSOR:
As a professor, you have the ability to change/edit the grades and exams. Once you have logged in with your email and password (that has been provided by the system admin) you are then greeted with the professor homepage. Three tabs will be shown above that displays: “Home”, “Courses”, and “Logout” each one with a different functionality. 



STUDENT:
	As a student, you will have to contact the System Admin to create an account for you and then you can login and view your classes and exams. On the home page,you have a “Home” tab which will take you to the homepage. You have a “Courses” tab where you can see all your classes and then you can select each class to view all your exams taken in that class. You also have a “Logout” tab where you can logout when you want to get off so if you are on a public computer your account will be safe.
